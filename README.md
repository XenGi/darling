FTDI helper for the future. With FT230X, blinky lights and USB-C! Also potentially the tinyest USB-C to Serial adapter in the world. :smiley:

__Got a smaller USB-C to serial adapter? Please send me a link!__

See [Octopart][octopart] for a detailed list with links.
With current prices this totals to â‚¬ 3.84 just for parts excluding costs for the PCB manufacturing. If you need a PCB, just ask. I have lots of them. :)

Create Gerber files
-------------------

After you exported the gerber and drill friles from KiCAD to a subdir like `gerber` you can use the [gerbolyze tool][gerbolyze] or the [webservice][gerbolyze_web] to add the artwork to it.

Install gerbolyze with [pipsi][pipsi]:

```
pipsi install gerbolyze
```

I already created the template with `gerbolyze render bottom gerber preview.png` and added the artwork to the correct places.
To add the results to the gerber files use:

```
gerbolyze vectorize bottom gerber gerber_art preview_002.png
```

This will create the needed gerber files including the artwork in a directory called `gerber_art`.

To create a ZIP file with the needed gerber files for a PCB fab:

```
cd gerber_art
zip darling.zip *.gbr *.drl
```

I recommend [JLCPCB][jlcpcb]. It's the cheapest way to get the PCBs and they offer decent quality.
If you want purple PCBs you can also use [OSHPark][oshpark].
If you want it faster and you're in Germany I uploaded it to [Aisler][aisler] to.
